# Time-in-different-cities
 A FreeRTOS project that implemented using Keil v5, in this project we develop a multitasking clock project where the current time in one of
10 cities in different countries can be selected from the PC keyboard. The time in the selected
city is then displayed on the LCD together with the name of the city. The user selects the city
where the time is to be displayed from a menu displayed on the PC screen.
